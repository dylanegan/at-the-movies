<h3>Brokeback Mountain</h3>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p> 
<p>Getting a release later in January is what I predict will be one of the best films of 2006, Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain, which stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as two cowboys who discover something rare and forbidden when they are working alone on Brokeback Mountain one summer. <BR><BR>At the end of summer Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) goes back down the mountain and marries his fiance Alma (Michelle Williams), has a couple of kids while Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), goes back to the rodeo. Four years down the track, after his own marriage to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), Jack initiates a reconnection. The relationship between the two men which endures for twenty years has an impact on both their marriages.<BR><BR>This exquisite film was made by the Ang Lee who seems to be able to bring such truth to his films, despite the wide variety of genres and cultures that he explores. With Brokeback Mountain he worked from a screenplay by Larry McMurtry’s and Diana Ossana which they adapted from a short story by E Annie Proulx.<BR><BR>In making Brokeback Mountain Lee has made all the right choices – using Rodrigo Prieto as cinematographer and Gustavo Santaolalla as composer, collaborators of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu on both Amores Perros and 21 Grams. The effect is sublime.<BR><BR>Casting Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal was a stroke of genius, neither have been better in their lives, they are just so beautiful and the rest of the cast is outstanding. For me, this is an absolutely perfect film in every way. So moving, so wonderfully done.</p>
<h3>Further comments</h3>
<p>MARGARET POMERANZ: For me, this is an absolutely perfect film in every way. So moving and so wonderfully done. David. <BR><BR>DAVID STRATTON: It is. It is, quite simply, a great love story. And it's done with such subtlety and such dignity and such grace. And as you say, Ang Lee is really an extraordinary director because he tackles so many different kinds of films. Who would believe that the man who made 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' could make such a subtle, tender film as this. <BR><BR>MARGARET POMERANZ: After 'Hulk'. <BR><BR>DAVID STRATTON: After 'Hulk'. <BR><BR>MARGARET POMERANZ: But, you know, every shot in this film, I have seen it twice now, and second time you just look at what he does with that camera, and every shot has a point. Do you know, this is why I go to the movies, for the possibility of seeing something as good as this. <BR><BR>DAVID STRATTON: It's so graceful and so tender. So pertinent. And people have mocked Heath Ledger a little bit for some of the things he's done. <BR><BR>MARGARET POMERANZ: He's wonderful in this. <BR><BR>DAVID STRATTON: But he is fantastic. And so is, I mean, the two of them are really good. And the women are good, too. It just is a really terrific film. I'm gonna give this 5 out of 5. <BR><BR>MARGARET POMERANZ: Look! I would give it 10 out of 5. I just think it's so sublime. <BR><BR>DAVID STRATTON: You can't.</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I find it hard to read some reviews of people who obviously missed the point entirely. I am also shocked that BB Mountain lost out to 'Crash' for best picture. This film encorporated everything 'film' as a medium has to offer. Obviously it was too understated and subtle for most people who need it spelled out for them like in 'Crash'.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;A good film, but I'm a little staggered by the amount of five-star ratings this is getting! The cinematography was superb, definitely, but I just didn't get the attraction between Jack & Ennis. They acted well, but the love was not palpable to me at all. "Walk the Line", I felt, had much more of an emotional punch. No, I'm not homophobic.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Incredibly well made with brilliant direction, cinematography and music. Why only two stars? This movie is a complete and utter waste of time. There is no point to the story, and though the acting was good, the script was incredibly boring. This movie is pointless.</P>

<i><strong>Score:</strong></i>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/img/five.gif"><br><br>
<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Brokeback Mountain is not staggering in its impact on you because of superficial concern for characters, but for how it somehow seduces you into confronting vicariously your own thwarted dreams, missed opportunities, thinly covered disappointments - even shame of your own unhappiness; so too your first loves, your great loves, the memory of love. One is 'ambushed' by one's own phantoms and fondest memories in potent and distilled form. It's not so much the movie that won't seem to leave us as our own soul's joys, sorrows and hopes, surfaced and in need of the light of day.<BR></P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;It is a great evocative film (although somewhat overated).However, I think the way everyone is carrying on about it being groundbreaking and the way jake and heath are getting patted on the back all the time for 'being so brave' is pathetic.Also in every interview I have seen with Heath its like he has to make a point of his heterosexuality, nauseating really. When hollywood brings out a film with 'out' gay actors playing straight then I think some real change may have been achieved. Basically I think this film is so digestible for mainstream audiences because the underlying message is that its ok because they arent really gay. Why do movies about gay men always end in hideous tragedy? either that or they are portrayed as limp wristed femmes. How bout a nice romantic comedy</P>

I enjoyed the story, but there was something on the night I just didn't connect with. <BR>I may go and see it again, preferably without the giggling and laughter during those poignent scenes, mostly coming from those insecure middle aged women in the audience. <BR>It's not a comedy people - lets look on it as a love story, not the gay cowboy movie!</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Of all the films I've seen in the last 10 years or so, this has moved me the most. More than that --- even now when I think of some scenes, I become tearful. The story is told in such an understated and quiet way that it grows on you, only to end in such a devastatingly emotional performance by Heath Ledger. A love story like this one should appeal to anyone, but to me, it resonates and sings. No one has expressed in film so accurately the terrible consequences of suppressed desires and unfulfilled lives.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I saw this movie on Sat night. The friend I went with cried at the end. I couldn't - I was dumbstruck. I woke up at 4:00am on Sunday monrning thinking about it. Even now describing it to firends I find it hard to put into words, beautiful can't describe it - I feel this movie so much it almost hurts. I can't get it out of my head and my heart!</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;What a lucky country and opportune time we live in. This is the film that had to happen, to remind us all of the internal / external struggles and predjudices all our (homosexual) forefathers were up against. With the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras just around the corner again, the community should close their eyes and imagine - no Mardi Gras, no out-and-proud gay people and no society diversity - how boring would it be? This film saddened me greatly - too many people I know, or have met along the way still feel the only way is the Ennis and Jack way -now, that's sad!</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;re my previous comment 1 Feb - wife and self saw it again for the 2nd time recently and must agree, you have to see it twice. None of the power, dignity or sadness was lost. Still walked out of the cinema elated and deeply moved. Thought I might have been caught up in the hype, but no. The 50 or so in the theatre on a dark rainy Melbourne night obviously felt the same, you could have heard a pin drop throughout. Still #1 movie for me for 2006!</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Took a girlfriend to see BBM and find out what all the fuss was about. So glad we left the boys behind. We were entertained adequately, although the acting , art direction (including scenery), costumes, plot and mumbled script screamed "average". Total chick flick. Painstakingly slow start. Great romantic comedy. The love scenes, (and come to think of it, the majority of the dialogue) between the two male leads reinforced my opinions on the male gender's lack of understanding of relationships beyond the purely physical. This film is about men being unfaithful, even to themselves, gay or not gay. I have been shocked at the increadible amount of reviewers touched by tenderness and emotion in this film because they were certainly not stand out points in t</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;This story is essentially the story of my own life, although it was set some 40 years ago. (Although it doesn't involve cowboys, Wyoming or sheep.) The limited options imposed on me and the hurt I continue to have to deal with, persists. You don't believe me? Well - here's a simple example - the tenderest moments of this film were punctuated by the giggling and "yuks" from the young women sitting behind me in the cinema. Was that you?</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Resonance; that rare quality where a movie touches the soul of the viewer, occurs with many who see Brokeback Mountain. This is probably due to the fact that the movie is utterly believable, to both opponents and supporters of the subject matter. Those sympathetic to the premise that hyper masculine men can be same sex attracted find resonance in the credibility and believability of the movie, which is exactly why those opposed to the premise find a threatening resonance in the movies humanizing portrayal of consenting adults whose love is constrained by an intolerant society and who are not demons as religious dogma would have it.<BR>The many skilful qualities, believability, and, resonance, coalesce to make Brokeback Mountain arguably the best tragic roman</P>

It was only highly rated b/c it was the first national homsexual movie. I am all for gay rights, and my best friend is a gay man, but this movie was just SICK SICK SICK. You don't go punching eachother, and then have sex, especially in the side yard with your wife and kids upstairs. This movie is NOT about supressed gay passion. IT is about 2 men that are sick in the head. They did not have ANY romance at all in their relationship. They didn't even TALK or know anything about each other b/c they didn't talk. It was just 2 guys.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I feel like I must be missing something...big! This is a very boring movie. So little said over such a long period of time. Thank heavens we didn't have to live every one of the twenty years. It's sortof a reverse homophobia, where we have to be excited because it's about two guys. Haven't we gotten over the excitment of seeing two men have sex or fall in love? This is really about media hype and hollywood still not openly acknowledging homosexuality. <BR>The movie is drab, the acting not as brilliant as promoted. It came from a short novel by Annie Prioux and it should have been translated into a short movie. I reckon it was too drawn out. <BR>One for the scenery.</P>

This movie moved me, even at times when I thought I was safe and that I wasnt going to cry i cried. The tears flowed in the last scene with Heath Ledger. Ang Lee has used beauty, skill and talent to collaborate a film with great actors wonderful scenery and subtle but strong composition in each shot(very Stanley<BR>Kubrick). I have read other reviews saying its to slow and the relationship doesnt develop. I feel that the relationship develops so beautifully because it exists in a beautifully shot film that gives the time to the viewer to absorb it all. Sad but a wonderful movie</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Margaret has it in one when she says that she goes to the movies in the hope of possibly seeing 'something as good as this'. This film is poignant, bitterly tragic and heartbreaking in its silence. This silence which conveys so much more than Ennis' laconic personality, but stands for unrealised desire and destiny. So many people I have spoken to say that they cannot get this film out of their mind, and I too had trouble thinking of anything but the haunting, sorrowful longing that the film explores. A true, tragic love story that cannot be missed.</P>

Williams adds to her fine performance in Wenders' Land Of Plenty and Ang Lee continues his magnificent list of Hits. Secrets can be dreadful things and this film intelligently investigates how they can affect us so deeply.</P>

It will remain with me for a long time to come...its impact is profound. Ang Lee's direction was masterful, subtle and finely nuanced. All the imagery and symbolism worked their magic, as did the stunning performances by the leads and supporting cast. This is, simply put, a masterpiece.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I have all respect for Ang Lee, however I wish that this film was put in the hands of independent filmmakers, with lesser known (and less attractive) actors and directed by someone like ATOM EGOYAN. It was good but could have been so much better. Also the addition of the last scene had Hollywood all over it - it was not part of the original short story, was not needed and ultimately may have stripped the film of its true sense of loss and sadness just as it was depicted and intended in Anne Proulxs short story.</P>

Unfortunately, I think it was let down by a lack of connection between the protagonists themselves and their wives. I had difficulty empathising with any of them (though I seem to be in the minority on this one). <BR>Contrast the relationship between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger - where Ang Lee and the actors succeeded in conveying deep emotion in a very restrained manner.<BR>Worth seeing, but don't expect too much...</P>

Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllelhaal deliver fine performances as the troubled cowhands torn between their enduring love for each other and the demands of the ultra conservative world in which they must operate. Health Ledger is the standout. This is a brave movie depicting a romance that is just impossible in its time and place, with great sensitivity.</P>

Men crying on screen, it just never happens enough! The bloody shirt Ennis found in Jacks room after his death, very sad.

I love it so much. The only dissapointing part of it was the mumbling, but everything else was just a gift.<BR><BR>Thank you for giving me this movie to cry over.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Like a few others, I have seen all Oscar nominated films for this year. I am absolutely unable to justify how Brokeback Mountain did not scoop a best picture oscar. This movie resonates with you long after the end. It makes you think, it makes you cry, it makes you want to move heaven and earth to enable this love to live. But this is where the love story would not have succeeded - for if they were able to live always and forever together - then this would not be the emotional and thought provoking piece of cinema that it most definately is. Well Done.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;The first hour and a half of this film was boring, the last half hour was torture. There was no chemistry between the cowboys, the dialogue was uninteresting, their relationship was based on lust rather than tenderness. The first love scene was really animalistic. This film missed every opportunity to be provocative and inspiring. Heath Ledger mumbled his way through his personalityless role. He wasn't even a likeable character. Even the scenery was disappointing. How can people get so excited by a mountain? This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Entertaining, yes certainly. Filmed well by Ang Lee, yes. In a gay context despite it's historical timeframe, I am disappointed that such a film in this day and age, still focuses on gay men as victims and repressed individuals. I want to see gay men and women portrayed with strength while facing and overcoming adversity. Tragic gay figures in film are safe and not threatening to a mainstream audience and that's why this film got made.</P>

It's so beautiful and real to watch. <BR><BR>Only took off half a star because I didn't detect a lot of chemistry between Heath and Jake, though I believed in the characters' love for each other. I notice a lot of male actors have chemistry, whether they're playing gay or straight, but these two did not. I didn't feel that palpable attraction. Also, I live in the Blue Mountains and had to go all the way to Sydney to see it. What's with it bypassing suburban cinemas?</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;The ultimate oxymoron – a great American film, sensitive and reflective, moving and profound, with a lovely balance of elegy and asperity. It is also potently political, its message all the more powerful for being demonstrated rather than stated. Fear of sexual difference, and the fear of the effects of others’ fear thereof, cripples and destroys lives, blights hope and often leaves love wholly unrecognised. In short, it screws up all parties touched by it. For some of us, this story is merely real life. Still, I only negotiated my way out of the cinema with the help of the handrail – and that was at my second viewing …</P>

Also the scence when they reunite after 4 years. I could feel Ennis's energy. Would have loved a happier ending but A must see movie. Will buy on DVD as well.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;All the raving reviews and Academy Award nominations are not exaggerations, and are not just related to the ‘daring nature’ of this film, as some may think. The fact that this story is the tragedy of an impossible love between two men only adds to the intensity of that tragedy because it renders that love impossible right from the start, and because it comes as such a surprise to both characters.<BR><BR>This is an absolutely brilliant film, in every way, from the performances to the direction to the cinematography. It is a must-see, and please don’t be put off by the ‘gay cowboy’ summaries floating around – that is not what this film is about. Through its beautiful, masterful depiction of the deepest tragedy of love, this film actually celebrates the great</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Any film that makes you think about its message, or makes you feel something about yourself and your life, is a good film. This is a great film, and it has touched me deeply. I liked the slow building and restraint of the story, because that is the life that these characters lived. Their idyllic time on Brokeback Mountain was never recreated, and the loneliness and tragedy of their lives and love is a very powerful message. I will remember this movie for a long time.</P>

Although it has some admirable technical qualities in terms of cinematography, direction etc I thought relationship between the central characters was not sufficiently developed. Also the fact the Ennis has basically no substance as a person made it difficult to feel any empathy with him. I don’t think it’s fair to put it in the same category (5 stars) as a truly outstanding film such as Mysterious Skin.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I have never been moved by a movie as much as this one. The cinematography, score, screenplay, costume and set pieces were excellent and worked together to give a profound impact. The pace is excellent, it is restrained and laidback for a purpose - the crucial scenes have a greater impact on the viewer and some scenes give pause so that the viewer is able to feel the impact of a prior scene and let it sink in. I was moved to tears by the end. Every scene, albeit some of which are brief or shown as flashbacks, is important. The intimate scenes between characters were portrayed honestly and treated with equal importance. It is appropriate that it began in the 1960s being pre-'gay liberation' because it reduces the options for the 2 main characters which led them to make choices whi</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Having now seen Brokeback three times, I am still overwhelmed by the beauty of it-which has only intensified on consecutive viewings. Ang Lee has created a masterpiece with both Heath and Jake honing their acting craft to perfection. My only concern is that these two actors will never again have the opportunity to create something so beautiful. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos. This film is about the intransigence of man and the tragedy of accepting less than we deserve. I am gay but this is a film for all of society. Yes, there is the issue of homophobia and its constraints on people like Jack and Ennis but this film is about humans and the love that is capable within them but so easily lost. Perfection.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;This film had the potential to be great. Good performances, beautiful cinematography an an incredibly touching connection between Jake and Ennis. It failed though to develop with any real depth the emotionality of the situation for the characters and how this touching love affected the whole of their lives. It glossed over these elements but didn't explore them nearly as much as it should have. It is still though a very worth while film to see and I will probably go and see it a second time because it is a very compelling tale.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I just sat there at the end, holding back the tears. Such an honest and beautiful film. Many who see intimacy between men as soley a "gay" thing will struggle to accept that these two characters fall in love. But Lee's film is not telling the story of two gay men - people (and most of the media, who are incorrectly calling this a "gay" film) who view it in such a way will miss the point. This is, at its most basic level, just a movie about two people who find each other and fall in love. Their gender is not relevant. Lee and his leading actors have shown courage and great sensitivity with this film - god knows compared to a lot of the dross being produced in Hollywood these day, a film such as this should be treasured.</P>

For those of you who think that “this is simply a gay cowboy movie”, I am sorry to say that it is much more than that. The movie lasts about 133 minutes, 1 minute about men making love, 1 minute about each man making love with their wives, and the rest of the 131 minutes is about how the bond between the two men are growing stronger and stronger and how their relationship has slowly and unconsciously impacted both of their lives. Love is simply a force</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;This film is still with me and I saw it three days ago! Jack and Ennis have entered my heart and their story is residing there. This film is on my mind, if I start to think about certain scenes, I am so moved, that I am brought to tears. The more I think about it, the more I understand. This film's union of directing, cinematography, score, acting and writing comes together to create something that is sublime, brilliant, superb, haunting and absolutely beautiful! Brokeback Mountain is now one of my top three favorite films of all time, and with each passing day it's becoming clear that it's most likely to become my favorite. What a marvellous feat at story telling. I'm going to see it again later this week. Congratulations to all involved! <BR><BR></P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;This film is a masterful tapestry depicting the love story of 2 young men whose tenderness and struggles is painted against a truly magnificent backdrop. Slow at times, the film is like a calm sea that at times is taken over by a giant wave of emotion and drama. It's interesting to discover the impact this film has had on so many people - it is a profound story of love behind the screen, existing in a beautiful place known only by Ennis and Jack, a secret world which, in this film could only exist as such.</P>

<i><strong>Score:</strong></i>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/img/five.gif"><br><br>
<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;This is a wonderful, seminal film, but I can't agree with the assessment expressed by Margaret on a recent edition of PM on ABC radio. "It's not about gay or, you know, cowboys… I mean, it's about two lonely people and this long-time love they have for one another, the connection they have." (PM - Tuesday, 10 January, 2006)<BR><BR>It is a simplistic and disingenuous to see this as merely a film about love or lonely people, It is about how social attitudes that resonate with fear towards homosexuality can cripple and destroy individuals and their families. Let's not forget that one of the characters was bashed to death, presumably because of his sexuality. It is subtle and beautifully expressed, but this is so much more than a tragic love story</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;Although I have some small criticisms in regards to how the characters aged and how sudden the sex was, I thought it was truly haunting and bitterly beautiful. I was literally choking back the gasps that come with crying so hard. This was my first "crying in the cinema" experience and I will never forget it - the story will never leave me.</P>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;I was expecting more from this movie as it has been so hyped-up. Of course, Heath and Jake are great in this, no question about it, very believable. But there wasn't much else to the movie other than that, they could have done so much more with it. I kept expecting certain storylines to continue but they ended abruptly with no resolution. Great scenery and acting but not much else to it than that...you may as well see it purely to see what all the hype is about.</P>

A must see move for all but realize it wont be everyone's cup of tea. This 44 YO is still suffering from shell shock! Love can be such an incredibly powerful emotion.

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i>&nbsp;It is hard to separate the film from my own life and to judge it properly. My first response was to be almost unmoved. why ? Too close to the bone ? I've lived like Ennis all my life. The grief he suffers is one of the main prisms through which I have viewed most of my life.For depicting this so that others may understand it, and perhaps view more compassionately the life of outsiders, I am grateful.</P>
